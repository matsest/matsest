Hello world! 👋

🥷 I'm a cloud architect, platform builder, Linux guy and consultant working on Azure.

🔨 I enjoy designing and building cloud-ready architectures, helping teams with adoption of cloud platforms and automating everything.

☁️ My consultancy work is mostly based around Azure CAF/Enterprise Scale, Infrastructure as Code, GitOps, PowerShell and enterprise architecture in general (network, security, identity, governance +++).

💡 Besides work I enjoy learning other cloud native technologies, solving programming challenges (preferrably with Go/Python) and contributing to open-source when I can.
